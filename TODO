----- DO NOW -----
1. DOCUMENTATION & PUBLICATION
2. Unit tests
3. project name with ... if too long
4. display with out of total and %
5. function for pipeline config path edit
6. function for download model with config
7. imageset constraints (same % of -1 and 1 in train and val)
8. image resize functionality
9. label inside image check
10. start training (run tf scripts)
11. GUI redesign - checkboxes with completed and status of files (and better user friendly display messages)
12. GUI Components for class modification


----- MAYBE IDEAS -----
1. save file with data for our program (information about projects it operated on and their states)
2. GUI scalability (multiple instances, windows)

----- DO IN THE FUTURE -----
1. automatic complete tf install script (with everything needed to run object detection api)
2. multiplatform compatibility
3. model config comparison 
4. trained model results comparison (tensors, graphs?)
5. schedule tasks
